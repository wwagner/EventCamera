# Event camera bias settings (0-255)
# These values control the analog biases in the event camera sensor
bias_diff = 128       # Event detection threshold - higher = less sensitive
bias_refr = 128       # Refractory period - prevents rapid re-triggering
bias_fo = 128         # Photoreceptor follower - output buffer strength
bias_hpf = 128        # High-pass filter - removes DC component
bias_pr = 128         # Pixel photoreceptor - amplification gain

# Frame generation settings
accumulation_time_s = 0.01    # Event accumulation period in seconds (range: 0.001-0.1)
                              # Lower values = more responsive but noisier
                              # Higher values = smoother but more latency
