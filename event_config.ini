# Event camera bias settings
# These values control the analog biases in the event camera sensor
# Note: Ranges vary by bias type - see individual comments
bias_diff = 0         # Event detection threshold (-25 to 23) - recommended to not change
bias_diff_on = 20     # ON event threshold (-85 to 140)
bias_diff_off = 20    # OFF event threshold (-35 to 190)
bias_fo = 0           # Photoreceptor follower (-35 to 55) - output buffer strength
bias_hpf = 100        # High-pass filter (0 to 120) - removes DC component
bias_refr = 0         # Refractory period (-20 to 235) - prevents rapid re-triggering

                             # Lower values = more responsive but noisier
                             # Higher values = smoother but more latency
